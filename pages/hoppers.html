    <section><h1>Hoppers</h1>
    <article><p>Hoppers, known as "Appa" in Sinhala and "Appam" in Tamil, are a popular and traditional 
        dish in Sri Lanka and South India. They are a type of pancake made from fermented rice flour and 
        coconut milk, with a distinctive bowl shape and crispy edges. Hoppers are versatile and can be enjoyed
        in various forms, often as a breakfast dish or a snack.</p><br></article>

    <dl><dt><h2>Types of Hoppers:</h2></dt>
    <dd> <blockquote><b>01. Plain Hoppers:</b> The most basic version, made from a simple batter of rice flour, 
        coconut milk, yeast (or sometimes toddy, a fermented palm drink), and a pinch of sugar and salt. 
        The blobatter is fermented, then ladled into a small, rounded pan. As the batter cooks, it forms a 
        crispy edge with a soft, spongy center.

    <br><br><b>02. Egg Hoppers:</b> Similar to plain hoppers, but with an egg cracked into the center while the batter is
     cooking. The egg is left to cook until the white is set, but the yolk remains runny, creating a delicious 
     combination of textures.

    <br><br><b>03. String Hoppers (Idiyappam):</b> A different form of hoppers made from steamed rice flour dough, which 
    is pressed through a special tool to create thin noodle-like strands. These strands are then steamed and 
    often served with curries or coconut sambol.

    <br><br><b>04. Milk Hoppers:</b> Similar to plain hoppers, but with a layer of coconut milk poured into the center
         before cooking. The result is a slightly sweeter, creamier hopper.</blockquote></dd> <br>   

    
    <dl><dt><h2>Ingredients:</h2></dt>
    <dd><blockquote><ul><li>Rice Flour: The base of the batter, giving the hoppers their unique texture.</li>
    <li>Coconut Milk: Adds richness and flavor to the batter.</li>
    <li>Yeast or Toddy: Used for fermentation, which gives hoppers their light, airy texture.</li>
    <li>Sugar and Salt: To balance the flavors.</li></ul></blockquote></dd><dl><br>
          

    <dl><dt><h2>Preparation:</h2></dt>
    <dd><blockquote><b>Step 1:</b><br> Making the Batter: The rice flour is mixed with coconut milk, sugar, salt, and yeast (or toddy) and left to ferment for several hours or overnight.
    <br><br><b>Step 2:</b><br>Cooking the Hoppers: A special small, rounded hopper pan (traditionally made of 
    cast iron or aluminum) is used. A ladle of the fermented batter is poured into the pan, which is then 
    swirled to spread the batter thinly around the sides. The pan is covered and the hopper is cooked until 
    the edges are crispy and the center is soft.</blockquote></dd><br>     
    

    <dl><dt><h2>Serving:</h2></dt>
    <dd><blockquote>Hoppers are typically served with a variety of accompaniments, such as:
    <ul><li>Pol Sambol: A spicy coconut relish made with grated coconut, chili, lime, and onions.</li>
    <li>Seeni Sambol: A sweet and spicy caramelized onion relish.</li>
    <li>Curry: Especially dhal (lentil) curry, chicken curry, or fish curry.</li>
