    <dl><dt><h2>Ingredients:</h2></dt>
   <dd> <blockquote><ul><li>Rice Flour: The base ingredient, often roasted before mixing with water to form a crumbly dough.</li>
    <li>Grated Coconut: Layered within the rice flour mixture, adding moisture and a subtle sweetness.</li>
    <li>Water: Mixed with the rice flour to create the right texture for steaming.</li>
    <li>Salt: To taste, usually added to the rice flour mixture.</li></ul></blockquote></dd><br>
 
    <dl><dt><h2>Preparation:</h2></dt>
    <dd><blockquote><b>Step 1:</b><br> Mixing the Dough: The rice flour is combined with water and salt to create a crumbly dough. The mixture should not be too wet or too dry.
        <br><br><b>Step 2:</b><br>Layering: The dough is then layered with grated coconut in a cylindrical mold called a "Pittu Bambuwa" or a perforated metal container.
        <br><br><b>Step 3:</b><br>Steaming: The filled mold is placed over a pot of boiling water and steamed until the pittu is cooked through. The steam cooks the rice flour, and the coconut infuses its flavor throughout the dish.</blockquote></dd><br>
